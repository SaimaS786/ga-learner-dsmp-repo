### Project Overview

 This project is about 'The Lego Collector's Dilemma' wherein we have to collect as many board sets as we can. Initially, we have to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that we can budget it from our revenue. The dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. The aim of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a linear regression model using various machine learning libraries.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I have applied the concepts of Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Linear Regression, MSE andR^2 Evaluation Metrics respectively.


### Challenges faced

 Few concepts were a bit confusing but I managed to work on them easily.
