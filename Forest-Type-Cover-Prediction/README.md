### Project Overview

  This project includes a problem statement which revolves around the need to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). It includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are: 1 - Spruce/Fir 2 - Lodgepole Pine 3 - Ponderosa Pine 4 - Cottonwood/Willow 5 - Aspen 6 - Douglas-fir 7 - Krummholz.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how feature selection affects the performance of a machine learning model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

  In this project, I applied the concepts of how are the features important to our model, how to select the most significant features out of many, how to perform univariate feature selection and how to perform a multivariate feature selection.
