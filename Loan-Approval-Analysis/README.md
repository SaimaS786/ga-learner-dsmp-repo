### Project Overview

 The project includes "Dream Housing Finance Inc." which specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Their loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. They need a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far to create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments.

### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The concepts of pandas DataFrame, basic and advanced panda operations were altogether taken into consideration while solving the problem.


### Challenges faced

 The concept of 'Advanced pandas operations' was quite difficult for me to get through.
