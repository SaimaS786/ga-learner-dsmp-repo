### Project Overview

 This project includes customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection. It is the loss of clients or customers. Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn. For this project the dataset of a telecom company will be explored and prediction of the customer churn will be done.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a boosting model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, I have appled the concepts of handling missing values in data, AdaBoost, XGBoost and interpreting evaluation metrics.


### Challenges faced

 No issues were faced by me while solving the problem.
