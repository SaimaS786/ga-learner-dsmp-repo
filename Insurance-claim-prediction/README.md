### Project Overview

 This project includes the prediction of the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset given contains information on the insurance claim. Each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, I applied the concepts of Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Logistic Regression, AUC score, ROC and AUC plot.
