### Project Overview

 This project includes publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. Here, Decision Tree model will be used and later classification will be done on whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have got a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, I applied the concepts of Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Decision Tree Modeling, Evaluation Metrics and Graphviz (an open source graph visualization software) plotting.


### Challenges faced

 No challenges were faced by me while solving the problem.
