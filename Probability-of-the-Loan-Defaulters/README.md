### Project Overview

 This project deals with the concept of probability. The data is taken from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. So in this project, we have found the solution to the problem: What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?
