### Project Overview

 This project includes the Melbourne housing data which we have to solve using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

  In this project, I applied the concepts of Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Ridge Regressor, R-square Evaluation Metrics respectively.


### Challenges faced

 No challenges were faced by me while solving the problem.
